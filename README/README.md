# ðŸŒŒ Space Mission Control System

A **cloud-native**, micro-services platform for end-to-end orchestration of space missions: from operator authentication and enterprise management, through mission lifecycles and spacecraft command & telemetry, to real-time dashboards.

## Architecture Overview

A high-level view of all componentsâ€”micro-services, databases, messaging and observabilityâ€”deployed on Kubernetes, with CI/CD through Jenkins and IaC via Terraform:

## Core Service Flows

### Authentication Flow

OAuth2 login, user sync and JWT issuance:

![Authentication Flow](auth_flow.png)  
*Figure 2: Sequence from client â†’ OAuth2 provider â†’ handler â†’ `OperatorService` â†’ token generation.*

---

### Enterprise Service

Aggregates data from Auth, Mission and Spacecraft services, and exposes both CRUD and aggregation endpoints:

![Enterprise Service Flow](entreprise_service.png)  
*Figure 3: `/api/enterprise` CRUD APIs and aggregation endpoints (`/operators`, `/missions`, `/spacecraft`) backed by Feign clients.*

---

### Gateway Routing

All external HTTP/WebSocket traffic funnels through the API Gateway, which multiplexes to each micro-service path:

![Gateway Routing](gateway_service.png)  
*Figure 4: Path-based routing via Spring Cloud Gateway (`/auth/**`, `/entreprise/**`, `/mission/**`, etc.).*

---

### Mission Service

Handles mission lifecycle operations, persists to its own PostgreSQL schema:

![Mission Service Flow](mission_service_flow.png)  
*Figure 5: Core ops (`createMission()`, `getMissions()`, `updateMission()`, `deleteMission()`) interacting with `mission_db`.*

---

### Spacecraft Service

Manages spacecraft metadata and command issuance; integrates with external satellite APIs and the Telemetry service:

![Spacecraft Service Flow](spacecraft_service.png)  
*Figure 6: Controller â†’ Service â†’ Repository â†’ PostgreSQL, plus Feign-based TelemetryClient and external N2YO API.*

---

### Telemetry Service

Ingests real-time and external telemetry, processes into TimeScaleDB and Kafka topics, and pushes via WebSockets:

![Telemetry Service Flow](telemetry_service.png)  
*Figure 7: Ingestion â†’ Processing â†’ WebSocket Handler (`/ws/trajectory`) and Kafka Producer/Consumer pipelines.*

---

### Dashboard Service

Aggregates metrics and events from all services into a unified view:

![Dashboard Service Flow](dashboard_service.png)  
*Figure 8: Feign clients (Operator, Mission, Spacecraft, Telemetry) behind a single `/dashboard` API.*

---

## Observability (LGTM Stack)

Centralized metrics, logs, traces and profiling via the Grafana/OTel-LGTM stack:

*Figure 9: OpenTelemetry Collector â†’ Prometheus, Tempo, Loki, Pyroscope â†’ Grafana UI.*

---

## Kubernetes Deployment Flow

Order of manifest application and the flow from storage to external ingress:

![Kubernetes Deployment Flow](kubernetes_Deployment_Architecture.png)  
*Figure 10: PVCs â†’ ConfigMaps/Secrets â†’ Deployments â†’ Services â†’ Ingress â†’ Users.*

---

## Domain Model (Class Diagram)

Core entities, enums and relationships across the micro-services:

![Domain Model Class Diagram](DIAGRAMME_de_classe.png)  
*Figure 11: `Enterprise`, `Operator`, `Mission`, `Spacecraft`, `Command`, `TelemetryData`, `SpacecraftSummary`, with cardinalities.*

---

## CI/CD with Jenkins

Declarative pipeline automates build, test, image release and Kubernetes rollout:

*Figure 12: Jenkinsfile stages â€“ Checkout â†’ Build â†’ Test â†’ Dockerize â†’ Push â†’ `kubectl apply`.*

## Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

Terraform modules provisioning the GKE cluster, managed databases, Kafka/Zookeeper and LGTM components:

---

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shady0503/space-mission-control.git
cd space-mission-control

# 1. Local development with Docker Compose
docker compose up --build -d

# 2. Inspect logs
docker compose logs -f mission-service

# 3. Tear down
docker compose down -v

# 4. Apply to Kubernetes
kubectl apply -f k8s/

# 5. (Optional) Provision GKE & managed infra via Terraform
cd infra/terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
```

- Frontend:  `http://localhost:3000`  
- API Gateway: `http://localhost:8080`  
- Services:    ports 8081â€¦8086
